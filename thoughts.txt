rating hand
give hard score?
minimum playability
depenedent on how many starters you need

ratings:
playable-full combo-main starter engine
playable-minimum combo-engine but not starter
non-playable: no engine/starters
additional comments:
fragile (loses to single interruption)-no extender/engine


ex kash
1 card starter-unicorn, planet, terra
2 card combos-fenrir/rise + spell
look for cards specifically?

find combination of hands/1 card starters
unicorn access in hand means playable to full combo
fenrir only in hand gets shit combo but still engine
fenrir + spell gets to full combo
rating playability-how well does it go through interruptions. number of extenders (obviously depenedent on the type of interruption)
skip the number and just go for categorizatoin?
unicorn = full combo
fenrir solo = shit combo, other cards determine offensive/defensive capability
how to handle garnets (big bang). automatically turn off full combo?
consistency but no starter (gamble hand)

how to categorize handtraps-defensive or offensive? ash is defensive i guess. shifter is offensive?
what does offensive mean? lowering opponent ceiling-imperm, ash, shifter? books would go here too
defensive: stopping opponent from lowering your ceiling. in that case ash is defensive for eclipse otherwise itd be offensive. its literally just lance then isnt it
